# Abstract

Here, I re-examine the analysis of Oeppen and Vaupel (2002).

# Life Expectancy Analysis

```{r}
# Load the gapminder unfiltered data frame into R
df <- gapminder::gapminder_unfiltered
```

```{r}
# Calculate the maximum life expectancy by year and the corresponding country with
# that maximum life expectancy.
df %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  filter(lifeExp == max(lifeExp)) %>%
  arrange(year) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = country)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```
